    Returns a Location object containing the latitude/longitude `dNorth` and `dEast` metres from the 
    specified `original_location`. The returned Location has the same `alt and `is_relative` values 
    as `original_location`.

    The function is useful when you want to move the vehicle around specifying locations relative to 
    the current vehicle position.
    The algorithm is relatively accurate over small distances (10m within 1km) except close to the poles.

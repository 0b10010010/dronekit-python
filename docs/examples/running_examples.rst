====================
Running the Examples
====================

To run the examples you will need to set up DroneKit as described in :ref:`get-started` (or the :ref:`quick-start`). 
Once you have the `source code <https://github.com/diydrones/dronekit-python/tree/master/example>`_, examples are started as described in the *Getting Started* section :ref:`getting-started-running_examples`.

The easiest way to get the DroneKit example source dode is to clone the **dronekit-python** repo on your machine:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone http://github.com/diydrones/droneapi-python.git

The examples are stored in the subdirectories of **/dronekit-python/example/**.
	


.. warning:: Propellers should be removed before testing examples indoors (on real vehicles).

.. _example_mission_basic:

======================
Example: Basic Mission
======================

This example demonstrates the basic mission operations provided by DroneKit-Python, including:
downloading missions from the vehicle, clearing missions, creating mission commands
and uploading them to the vehicle, monitoring the current active command, and changing the active 
command. 

The guide topic :ref:`auto_mode_vehicle_control` provides more detailed explanation of how the API
should be used.

.. warning:: 

    At time of writing this example fails with an exception in DKYP2: `#355 DKPY2 Can't clear waypoints <https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python/issues/355>`_.

.. todo:: 

    Check if `#355 DKPY2 Can't clear waypoints <https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python/issues/355>`_ is fixed and re-review example.


Running the example
===================

The example can be run as described in :doc:`running_examples` (which in turn assumes that the vehicle
and DroneKit have been set up as described in :ref:`get-started`).
    
If you're using a simulated vehicle, remember to :ref:`disable arming checks <disable-arming-checks>` so 
that the example can run.

In summary, after cloning the repository:

#. Navigate to the example folder as shown:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd dronekit-python\examples\mission_basic\


#. Start the example, passing the :ref:`connection string <get_started_connect_string>` you wish to use in the ``--connect`` parameter:

   .. code-block:: bash

       python mission_basic.py --connect 127.0.0.1:14550

   .. note::
   
       The command parameter above is the default, and may be omitted. This
       connects to SITL on udp port 127.0.0.1:14550.

       
.. tip::

    It is more interesting to watch the example above on a map than the console. The topic :ref:`viewing_uav_on_map` 
    explains how to set up *Mission Planner* to view a vehicle running on the simulator (SITL).


On the command prompt you should see (something like):

.. code:: bash

    \dronekit-python\examples\mission_basic>mission_basic.py

How does it work?
=================

The :ref:`source code <example_mission_basic_source_code>` is relatively self-documenting, and most of its main
operations are explained in the guide topic :ref:`auto_mode_vehicle_control` .

In overview, the example first calls ``clear_mission()`` to clear the current mission and then creates and 
uploads a new mission using ``adds_square_mission(vehicle.location,50)``. This function defines a mission with a takeoff 
command and four waypoints arranged in a square around the central position.

After taking off (in guided mode using the ``takeoff()`` function) the example starts the mission by setting the mode to AUTO:

.. code:: python

    print "Starting mission"
    # Set mode to AUTO to start mission
    vehicle.mode = VehicleMode("AUTO")
    vehicle.flush()

The progress of the mission is monitored in a loop. The convenience function 
:ref:`distance_to_current_waypoint() <auto_mode_mission_distance_to_waypoint>` 
gets the distance to the next waypoint and 
:py:func:`Vehicle.commands.next <dronekit.lib.CommandSequence.next>` gets the value of
the next command.

We also show how to move to a specified command using
:py:func:`Vehicle.commands.next <dronekit.lib.CommandSequence.next>` (note how we skip the third command below):

.. code:: python

    while True:
        nextwaypoint =vehicle.commands.next
        if nextwaypoint  > 1:
            print 'Distance to waypoint (%s): %s' % (nextwaypoint, distance_to_current_waypoint())
        if nextwaypoint ==3: #Skip to next waypoint
            print 'Skipping to Waypoint 4 when reach waypoint 3'
            vehicle.commands.next=4
        if nextwaypoint ==5: #Skip to next waypoint
            print "Exit 'standard' mission when start heading to final waypoint (5)"
            break;
        time.sleep(1)

When the vehicle starts the 5th command the loop breaks and the mode is set to RTL (return to launch).


.. _example_mission_basic_known_issues:

Known issues
============

This example fails in DroneKit 2.0.0b6 (see `#355 DKPY2 Can't clear waypoints  <https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python/issues/355>`_).


.. todo:: 

    This is blocked by https://github.com/dronekit/dronekit-python/issues/355 (vehicle.commands.clear not working).
    The code output in "running the example needs to be updated once this runs cleanly.
    The above text for the error needs to be replaced with original text 
       > "This example works around the :ref:`known issues in the API <auto_mode_mission_known_issues>`. 
       > Provided that the vehicle is connected and able to arm, it should run through to completion."
    Need to check all that clearing is still strictly necessary in DKPY2 which handles race conditions more gracefully.
    Add image of waypoints /flight for top of page.

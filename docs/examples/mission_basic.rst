.. _example_mission_basic:

======================
Example: Basic Mission
======================

This example demonstrates the basic mission operations provided by DroneKit-Python, including:
downloading missions from the vehicle, clearing missions, creating mission commands
and uploading them to the vehicle, monitoring the current active command, and changing the active 
command. 

The guide topic :ref:`auto_mode_vehicle_control` provides more detailed explanation of how the API
should be used.


Running the example
===================

The vehicle and DroneKit should be set up as described in :ref:`get-started`.

If you're using a simulated vehicle remember to :ref:`disable arming checks <disable-arming-checks>` so 
that the example can run. 

Once MAVProxy is running and the API is loaded, you can start the example by typing: ``api start mission_basic.py``.

.. note:: 

    The command above assumes you started the *MAVProxy* prompt in a directory containing the example script. If not, 
    you will have to specify the full path to the script (something like):
    ``api start /home/user/git/dronekit-python/examples/mission_basic/mission_basic.py``.


On the *MAVProxy* console you should see (something like):

.. code:: bash

    MAV> api start mission_basic.py

How does it work?
=================

The :ref:`source code <example_mission_basic_source_code>` is relatively self-documenting, and most of its main
operations are explained in the guide topic :ref:`auto_mode_vehicle_control` .

In overview, the example first calls ``clear_mission()`` to clear the current mission and then creates and 
uploads a new mission using ``adds_square_mission(vehicle.location,50)``. This function defines a mission with a takeoff 
command and four waypoints arranged in a square around the central position.

After taking off (in guided mode using the ``takeoff()`` function) the example starts the mission by setting the mode to AUTO:

.. code:: python

    print "Starting mission"
    # Set mode to AUTO to start mission
    vehicle.mode = VehicleMode("AUTO")
    vehicle.flush()

The progress of the mission is monitored in a loop. The convenience function 
:ref:`distance_to_current_waypoint() <auto_mode_mission_distance_to_waypoint>` 
gets the distance to the next waypoint and 
:py:func:`Vehicle.commands.next <droneapi.lib.CommandSequence.next>` gets the value of
the next command.

We also show how to move to a specified command using
:py:func:`Vehicle.commands.next <droneapi.lib.CommandSequence.next>` (note how we skip the third command below):

.. code:: python

    while True:
    nextcommand=vehicle.commands.next
    if nextcommand > 1:
        print 'Distance to waypoint (%s): %s' % (nextcommand, distance_to_current_waypoint())
    if nextcommand==3: #Skip to next waypoint
        print 'Skipping to Waypoint 4 when reach waypoint 3'
        vehicle.commands.next=4
    if nextcommand==5: #Skip to next waypoint
        print "Exit 'standard' mission when start heading to final waypoint (5)"
        break;
    time.sleep(1)

When the vehicle starts the 5th command the loop breaks and the mode is set to RTL (return to launch).


.. _example_mission_basic_known_issues:

Known issues
============

This example works around the :ref:`known issues in the API <auto_mode_mission_known_issues>`. 
Provided that the vehicle is connected and able to arm, it should run through to completion.

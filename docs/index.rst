Welcome to DroneKit Python's documentation!
====================================

DroneKit Python provides interfaces for creating  applications that run on an onboard Linux computer communicating directly to the autopilot of 3DR-powered vehicles or applications that run on a personal computer communicating with vehicles over a wireless connection.

DroneKit is compatible with all vehicles using the `MAVLink protocol <http://qgroundcontrol.org/mavlink/start>`_. This includes most vehicles made by 3DR and other members of the `DroneCode foundation <https://www.dronecode.org/about/project-members>`_.
